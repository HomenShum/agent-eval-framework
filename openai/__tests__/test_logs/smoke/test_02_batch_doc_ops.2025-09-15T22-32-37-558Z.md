Input.query: Create a 'Prospecting Report — Sam Altman' under user 'Reports/Prospecting'. You may use info from global nodes (People/Investors, Market Intel) but do NOT modify global nodes. Append any new nodes ONLY under the user root. After creating the report, call add_relation linking it to 'global/People/Founders/Sam Altman' using relationType 'relatedTo'. Finish with a summary.
Input.context: User has Reports/Prospecting; Global has People and Market Intel.

Seed.paths:
- user/Reports/Prospecting => OK
